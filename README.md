# maddie.wtf

My personal website and blog, hosted at [maddie.wtf]. This is essentially a custom static site
generator, which server-side renders everything and serves it with [`axum`][axum].

A few slightly cool things it does:

- It watches for filesystem notifications in the content directory using [`notify`][notify] and
  hot-reloads any changed content. When running in debug mode, it also automatically reloads the
  page when this happens.
- Custom middleware intercepts `HandlerError`s returned from the request handlers and renders them
  with a template just like any other page, making the error handling code for each endpoint
  minimal.
- Commit info is gathered at build time so that the footer on every page can link back to the exact
  version that's being served.

## Development

### Set up Rust toolchain

If you're using `rustup`, there's a `rust-toolchain.toml` file in the root of the repository that
specifies the toolchain needed to build the crate. To format the code, though, you'll have to
install a nightly toolchain and ensure it contains the `rustfmt` component, and then format with
`cargo +nightly fmt` or `rustup nightly run rustfmt`.

If you're using Nix, there's a flake that defines a dev shell with a Rust toolchain (including
nightly `rustfmt`) and a few other useful tools included. You can load this either with `nix
develop` or via the [`direnv`][direnv] `.envrc` file, and then build the crate as normal with `cargo
build`. Formatting should work out of the box with `cargo fmt` or `rustfmt`.

There's also a Nix package defined in the flake for release builds.

### Cutting a Release

This project uses [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits], and [`convco`][convco] is included
in the Nix devShell to assist with this.

The overall list of things that has to happen for each release is as follows:

- The commit that changes the version should use the message `release: v<version>`.
- That commit should update the version in `Cargo.toml` to match the version output by `convco
  version --bump`.
- That commit should include an updated `Cargo.lock` file, most easily generated by running a `cargo
  build` after updating the version.
- That commit should include an updated `Cargo.nix` file, generated using `cargo2nix -ls > Cargo.nix
  && nix fmt`.
- That commit should include the updated `CHANGELOG.md`, generated with `convco changelog -u
  $(convco version --bump) > CHANGELOG.md`.
  - Unfortunately, after doing this you'll have to update the file to replace `HEAD` in the URL in
    the new section heading with `v<version>`.
- That commit should be tagged with `v<version>`.
- The commit should be pushed to `main`, and the tag pushed as well. This will trigger the
  [`cargo-dist`][cargo-dist] workflow to build the artifacts and create the release on GitHub.
